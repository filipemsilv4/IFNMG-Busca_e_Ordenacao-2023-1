Answers to the Labs of the discipline Search and Sorting at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Northern Minas Gerais.

I had a lot of fun with this class, as the professor gave us freedom to make our programs the way we wanted, so I spent a lot of time making TUIs (Terminal User Interface).

- Lab1: Bubble Sort implementation on both dynamic and static allocated lists, a "StressMode" for testing performance and a bunch of jokes about zero-sized lists.
- Lab2: A TUI made with ncurses. Oh, and also QuickSort.
- Lab3: A better TUI with lots of code improvements, a brand new Makefile, heap sort, merge sort and a (commented) ncurses port of Andy Sloane's famous spinning donut (loved the original donut.c but it was Windows specific so I ported it to ncurses so I could run it on Linux).
- Lab4: KMP algorithm (No TUI here ðŸ˜¿).
